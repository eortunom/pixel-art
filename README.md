# pixel-art
PixelArt (placeholder name) is my final project for CIS 197 - JavaScript. The intention is to create a website where users can log in and create pixel art. Once they're done, they can post it to the website and have other users look at it.

I finished working on the canvas page and have implemented a `clear` button and a `fill` checkbox. The implementation for the canvas can be found in `pixel-canvas.js`.

My next step is to get the server parts running to allow a user to save a particular painting that won't disappear when refreshing.
